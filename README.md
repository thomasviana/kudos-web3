# kudos-web3 (POC)

Tech companies are investing to explore web3 use cases. Zemoga, a Media.Monks company, is working on an internal project to give different kind of kudos to their employees as NFTs. From anniversary badges to teamwork or leadership kudos, their employees will have the proven experience or achievements as Non-Fungible-Tokens. This is just a POC to interact with a test smart contract in the Rinkeby test network.
